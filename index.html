                    1632 AD around a spring by Ali Mardan Khan, a governor of Mughal emperor Shah Jahan as per the orders of the Emperor, as a gift for 
                    his elder son Prince Dara Shikoh. The garden is located in the Zabarwan Range, near Raj Bhawan (Governor‘s house)

                <p>
                    On festivals such as Herath, as Maha Shivaratri is known as in the region, the temple is visited by Kashmiri Hindus. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The temple and adjacent land is a Monument of National Importance, centrally protected under the Archaeological Survey of India.[2][3] Dharmarth Trust has managed

                Wular Lake was also called Mahapadmasar. Nilamata Purana also mentions it as Mahapadmasaras. The lake, with its big dimensions and the extent of water, gives rise to high leaping waves in
                 the afternoons, called Ullola in Sanskrit, meaning "stormy leaping, high rising waves". Therefore, it was also called Ullola.
            </p>
            <p>
                 It is believed to have gotten corrupted over the centuries to Wulor or Wular.
            </p>
            <P>
                The origin may also be attributed to a Kashmiri word 'Wul', which means a gap or a fissure, appellation that must have come also during this period.
